This is our group project for a drug monitoring software for 355.
A logging software meant to collect meaningful patient observations regarding their medication usage. The patient's relevant medical information, such as age, weight, illnesses, etc. will be collected, as will prescribed medications and treatment plans. The software will collect data for the duration of the treatment period, whether it be a period of time or indefinitely. Then, said data would be exported to be viewed when requested. Strictly Ethical.
