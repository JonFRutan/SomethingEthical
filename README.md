This is our group project for a drug monitoring software for 355.

Project Description: 
A logging software meant to collect meaningful patient observations regarding their medication usage. The
patient's relevant medical information, such as age, weight, illnesses, etc. will be collected, as will prescribed
medications and treatment plans. The software will collect data for the duration of the treatment period,
whether it be a period of time or indefinitely. Then, said data would be exported to be viewed when
requested. Strictly Ethical.
